Play this game and guess the age of objects in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC! Flip through the carousel and see all available images of the object -- maybe you'll find a hint to its date on a painting's back. Choose to see all available objects, or just highlights or objects in a particular department.

The game uses the Met's generous [open access](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess) data available through its [API](https://metmuseum.github.io).

Built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com), and [Pure React Carousel](https://github.com/express-labs/pure-react-carousel).
